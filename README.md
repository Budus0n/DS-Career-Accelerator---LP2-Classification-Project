Customer Churn Prediction
Vodafone, a global telecommunications leader, faces increasing competition in a dynamic marketplace. To maintain its competitive edge, it seeks to understand customer behavior—specifically, which customers are at risk of leaving and why. This project aims to develop a predictive model to forecast customer churn, identify key indicators of churn, and provide actionable insights for customer retention.

The core objectives of this project include:

Building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of churn.
Identifying key factors driving customer churn.
Offering strategies to improve customer retention.
🛠 Built With
Tech Stack
Database: SQL (for data storage and management)
Language: Python (for analysis and model building)
Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, among others

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations of customer behavior, contract types, and churn likelihood.
Prediction Functionality: Users can select different machine learning models to predict churn.
Real-Time Data: Proprietary data is loaded from a remote server in real-time for analysis.
Prediction History: All predictions are saved for future analysis, allowing users to review past input values and model outcomes.
